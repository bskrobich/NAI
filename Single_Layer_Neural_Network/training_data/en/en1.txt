Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel overnight on Saturday, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria.

The reprisals marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil, marking a dangerous new inflection point in the fast-widening Middle East conflict.

In the aftermath of the attack, Tehran has continued to make threats against Tel Aviv and its Western allies, warning that its response will be "stronger and more resolute" if Israel continues to commit "military aggression."
