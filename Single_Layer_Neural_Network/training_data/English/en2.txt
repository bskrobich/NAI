While Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was watching his team play Real Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday, his watch was making headlines around the world.

Guardiola was wearing an extravagant Richard Mille watch worth £1 million ($1.26 million) on his wrist at Madrid’s Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, according to TNT Sports, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company. 

The limited-edition timepiece — one of only 50 ever made — is the lightest mechanical watch ever made, according to the designer, weighing only 18.83 grams including the strap. That’s equivalent to about four sheets of A4 or US letter-size paper.
