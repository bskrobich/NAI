No Doubt performed their long-awaited reunion set at the Coachella music festival this weekend, bridging the gap between their ’90s roots and the festival’s young audience with help from Olivia Rodrigo.

The “Drivers License” singer made a surprise appearance at the festival on Saturday, joining original band members Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont and Adrian Young on stage during the band’s 2000 hit “Bathwater,” which was released nearly three years before Rodrigo was born.

The setlist included some of their most beloved songs including “Sunday Morning,” “Don’t Speak” and “Spiderwebs,” among many others. Old video footage of the punk band’s heyday played on the video screens throughout the set, according to social media posts.
