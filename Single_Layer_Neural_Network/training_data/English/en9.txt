Ethiopia’s Sisay Lemma won his first Boston Marathon title on Monday, finishing with a time of 2:06:17 in the men’s race, while Hellen Obiri of Kenya retained her 2023 title in the women’s race.

Lemma, who is the fourth-fastest man in history after his 2:01:48 finish in the Valencia Marathon last month, set the early pace, racing into a big lead.

And although the chasing pack closed the gap on Lemma as the race progressed, the 33-year-old was able to hold on for his second major marathon victory after winning the 2021 London Marathon.
