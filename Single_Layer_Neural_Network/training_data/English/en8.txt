The return of her songs on the popular social platform comes as she is set to release her latest and much-anticipated album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” next week. On Thursday, CNN was able to locate Swift’s songs in TikTok’s music catalog, which can be used for anyone creating new videos.

In January, Universal Music Group pulled music from its various artists, including Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello and Rihanna, after releasing a statement titled, “An open letter to the artist and songwriter community — why we must call time out on TikTok,” in which it said its licensing agreement with the platform was expiring.

Universal Music Group said at the time TikTok proposed paying its artists and songwriters “a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay.”
