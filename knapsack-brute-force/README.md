# Brute-Force Algorithm for the Knapsack Problem

## Description

Implementation of a brute-force algorithm in C++ to solve the knapsack problem. The algorithm generates all possible item combinations, sums their weights and values, and then compares them with the knapsack capacity. It returns the characteristic vector (indicating which items are in the knapsack), the total weight, and the total value of the best solution.
